# Herta

Herta is a Java desktop task manager for managing todos, deadlines, and events.
See the [Herta User Guide](docs/README.md) for installation and command usage.

## Setting up in IntelliJ IDEA

Prerequisite: JDK 25. Update IntelliJ IDEA to the most recent version.

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA. If you are not on the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` first.
1. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA as follows:
   1. Click `Open`.
   1. Select the project directory, and click `OK`.
   1. If there are any further prompts, accept the defaults.
1. Configure the project to use **JDK 25** as explained in the [JetBrains JDK setup guide](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html#set-up-jdk).<br>
   In the same dialog, set the **Project language level** field to the `SDK default` option.
1. To run the command-line version, locate `src/main/java/herta/Herta.java`,
   right-click it, and choose `Run Herta.main()`. If the code editor shows
   compile errors, try restarting IntelliJ IDEA. If setup is correct, you
   should see output similar to this:
   ```
    _   _           _
   | | | | ___ _ __| |_ __ _
   | |_| |/ _ \ '__| __/ _` |
   |  _  |  __/ |  | || (_| |
   |_| |_|\___|_|   \__\__,_|
   ```

To launch the graphical interface, run `.\gradlew.bat run` from the project
root on Windows or `./gradlew run` on macOS/Linux.

**Warning:** Keep `src/main/java` as the Java source root. Do not rename these
folders or move Java files outside this path, as Gradle and other tools expect
this standard project layout.

## Building and testing

From the project root, run:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat test
.\gradlew.bat shadowJar
```

Use `./gradlew test` and `./gradlew shadowJar` on macOS/Linux. The packaged
application is written to `build/libs/Herta.jar`.

## Task data policy

Herta stores active tasks in `data/herta.txt` and archived tasks in
`data/archive.txt`. Duplicate task records are allowed, and task descriptions
and dates are validated before saving.

## Git commit checks

Enable the repository's local commit-message hook once after cloning:

```powershell
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

The hook rejects overlong commit subjects and body lines, and requires a body
for commits that contain substantial changes. It runs before Git creates the
commit, so formatting problems are caught locally rather than by CI.

## AI Assistance

I have used OpenAI Codex as an AI-assisted coding tool throughout the development of this project. It was used to suggest, generate, explain, debug, and refine code, including command parsing, command dispatch, task operations, and EOF handling. I reviewed, adapted, and tested the resulting code.

The project has reached the stretch goal of using JUnit to test all non-trivial
public methods across all classes, while excluding trivial constructors and
accessors. JUnit tests must be reviewed and updated after every code change so
that affected methods remain covered and this level of coverage is maintained.
