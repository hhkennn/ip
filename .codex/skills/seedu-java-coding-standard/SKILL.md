# Seedu Java Coding Standard

Apply this skill to every new or modified Java source file in this project, including
tests. Preserve behavior and public APIs unless the user explicitly requests a
behavioral change. Use the source guide for details not repeated here:
[SE-EDU Java coding standard](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/java/intermediate.html).

## Naming

- Keep package names lowercase; use the project name followed by logical package
  names (for example, `herta.parser`).
- Use English names. Name classes and enums as PascalCase nouns, methods as
  camelCase verbs, variables as camelCase, and constants as
  `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`.
- Test methods may use up to three underscore-separated parts in the form
  `featureUnderTest_testScenario_expectedBehavior`.
- Do not write acronyms as consecutive capitals in identifiers (`xmlParser`, not
  `XMLParser`). Use longer names for values with wider scope and short names only
  for local scratch values. Use `i`, `j`, or `k` for iterators, with `j` and `k`
  reserved for nested loops.
- Name booleans so they read as predicates (`is`, `has`, `can`, `should`, or
  `was`), use the same convention for boolean setters' parameters, and use
  plural names for collections. Give related constants a shared prefix.

## Layout and whitespace

- Use four spaces for indentation; never use tabs.
- Keep lines at or below 120 characters, aiming for 110 or fewer. When wrapping,
  indent continuation lines by eight spaces beyond the parent line and break at
  readable, higher-level boundaries (usually after commas or before operators).
  Keep method names attached to their opening parenthesis.
- Use K&R braces. Keep method, constructor, conditional, loop, switch, and
  try/catch declarations in the standard multiline form. Put `else` and
  `catch` on the closing-brace line.
- Surround operators and binary/ternary colons with spaces; put spaces after
  reserved words, commas, and `for` semicolons. Separate logical units in a
  block with one blank line.

## Statements and declarations

- Put every class in a package. Keep imports explicit, minimal, and consistently
  ordered. In this project, use static imports first, then `java`/`javax`,
  `org`, and other third-party imports alphabetically within each group.
- Attach array brackets to the type (`String[] values`). Initialize variables at
  declaration when practical and keep them in the smallest scope possible.
- Keep class fields non-public, except for constants and behavior-free data
  classes.
- Always use braces around loop and conditional bodies, including one-statement
  bodies. Put a conditional body on separate lines. Mark intentional switch
  fall-through with an explicit `// Fallthrough` comment.

## Comments and Javadoc

- Write comments in English using American spelling, without local slang. Indent
  comments with the code they describe.
- Add descriptive Javadoc to every public class and public method, except
  getters/setters, applicable overrides, and test code. Start with a short
  present-tense summary such as `Returns ...` or `Adds ...`; document parameters,
  return values, and thrown exceptions when they add useful information. Keep the
  Javadoc immediately above its declaration with standard leading asterisks and
  spacing.
- Add concise Javadoc to non-obvious class members.

## Verification

After changing Java code, review the relevant tests and run the project checks
with Java 25. Use Checkstyle as the automated conformance check; do not weaken
the project Checkstyle configuration to hide a violation. For topics this guide
does not cover, follow the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).
